  notes: |
    Daily/weekly experiments for neuromorph decoding, eco-budget tuning,
    and aura calibration. All runs are host-sovereign, non-financial,
    and evolution-neutral unless explicitly promoted via EvolutionUpgrade.
    Invited pain is modeled distinctly from harm and may permit stronger
    evolution steps, but only when host-owned consent shards are active.

host_preferences:
  invited_pain:
    doctrine: |
      Pain consciously invited for growth is NOT classified as harm.
      Runtime must:
        - Distinguish invited_pain from harm_pain.
        - Never let external AI, platforms, or policies override invited_pain.
        - Still enforce hard biophysical floors (BLOOD/OXYGEN/NANO/eco).

  non_blunting_rules:
    - id: "no_external_pain_blunting"
      rule: |
        No external system or AI-chat may:
          - Reduce DECAY, or
          - Increase comfort thresholds, or
          - Force downgrade of invited_pain classification
        without a host-local ALN/DID signature and explicit shard.
    - id: "no_forced_analgesia"
      rule: |
        Neuromorph reflex lanes may not auto-apply "pain masking" patterns
        that hide true biophysical distress. They may:
          - Re-route load, or
          - Adjust WAVE/NANO eco usage,
        but cannot suppress pain telemetry to eligibility filters.
