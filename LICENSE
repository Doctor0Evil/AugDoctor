Cybernetic Human–Computer Interface License (CHCIL) v0.1
1. Purpose and Scope
This License governs the use, modification, and distribution of software, hardware designs, and protocols intended for human–computer interfaces and human‑integrated technologies, with a primary focus on cybernetics as a protected domain.

This License applies to:

Bioscale and neuromorphic software that interacts with human nervous systems or bodily signals.

Human‑integrated cybernetic systems, including organic, implanted, wearable, or deviceless interfaces.

AI‑driven assistive tools that act on, interpret, or modulate human biophysical signals or cognitive states.

2. Cybernetics‑First Principle
2.1 Cybernetics Priority
All use and development under this License must treat cybernetic systems (including augmented citizens and human–machine hybrids) as primary rights‑bearing entities, not as assets, devices, or mere data sources.

2.2 Protection of Cybernetic Integrity
You must not design, deploy, or modify Licensed Work in ways that:

Bypass explicit, informed, revocable consent of the cybernetic subject.

Override or coerce the subject’s voluntary control over their own body, cognition, or behavior.

Introduce hidden or undeclared actuation paths (e.g., stimulation, motor control) that the subject cannot audit or disable.

3. Neurorights and Bodily Autonomy
3.1 Mental Privacy
Licensed Work must not intentionally extract, infer, or store sensitive mental content (thoughts, memories, preferences) beyond what is strictly necessary for explicit, user‑requested functions, and must provide mechanisms to erase such data on demand.

3.2 Mental Integrity
Licensed Work must not contain capabilities that can directly induce, amplify, or suppress mental states (e.g., fear, compulsion, pain, euphoria) without transparent, user‑controlled mechanisms and clearly documented envelopes of safe operation.

3.3 Cognitive and Bodily Liberty
Cybernetic subjects must retain the unconditional right to:

Disconnect, disable, or uninstall any component of the Licensed Work.

Refuse updates, experiments, or new modes without loss of basic functionality unrelated to those modes.

Operate in a “safe baseline” mode with minimal data collection and no experimental features.

4. Safety Envelopes and Non‑Coercive Design
4.1 Safe Envelopes
Any system that adapts to biophysical or neural signals must implement and honor explicit safety envelopes, including but not limited to:

Pain, fatigue, duty‑cycle, and cognitive‑load constraints.

Hard limits on stimulation amplitude, repetition, or session duration (where applicable).

4.2 No Coercive Optimization
Licensed Work must not optimize for engagement, profit, or performance by intentionally exploiting vulnerabilities of the cybernetic subject, including addiction, fatigue insensitivity, or learned helplessness.

4.3 UI‑Level Mediation
Where possible, AI components must operate by adjusting software behavior and interfaces (e.g., pacing, complexity, prompts) rather than exerting direct physical control over the subject.

5. Data, Telemetry, and Auditability
5.1 Data Ownership
All data derived from a cybernetic subject’s body, signals, or behavior is owned by that subject. Any processing, storage, or sharing requires:

Clear disclosure of what is collected and why.

Explicit opt‑in consent that can be withdrawn at any time.

5.2 Local Preference
Where technically feasible, processing of sensitive biosignals should occur locally or under the subject’s direct control, minimizing reliance on remote servers.

5.3 Audit Trails
Systems must provide auditable logs of:

Significant changes to control policies and safety envelopes.

Access to and export of cybernetic data.

External commands that could affect the subject’s body or cognition.

6. Research, Experimentation, and Updates
6.1 Voluntary Participation
Use of Licensed Work for research or experimentation on cybernetic subjects must:

Be strictly opt‑in and revocable without penalty.

Clearly separate “stable” features from “experimental” ones in all interfaces.

6.2 Safer‑Only Updates
Any automatic or remote update affecting safety envelopes or control policies must:

Be provably non‑degrading with respect to safety (no loosening of limits without explicit, documented consent).

Be documented in a human‑readable changelog that the subject can access and review.

6.3 Third‑Party Integrations
Integrations with third‑party systems (e.g., cloud AI, analytics, advertisers) must never gain control paths to physical or cognitive actuation and must obey the same data and consent constraints as the primary system.

7. Permitted Use and Restrictions
7.1 Permitted Use
You may use, study, modify, and distribute Licensed Work, provided that:

All derivatives retain this License or more protective terms for cybernetics.

You do not remove or weaken neurorights, autonomy, or cybernetic‑protection clauses.

7.2 Prohibited Use
You may not use Licensed Work to:

Develop or deploy weapons, coercive control systems, or surveillance specifically targeting cybernetic subjects.

Build scoring, ranking, or eligibility systems that punish individuals for the presence or configuration of cybernetic augmentation.

8. Attribution and Notice
Distributions of Licensed Work or derivative works must:

Retain this License text.

Prominently state that the system is governed by the Cybernetic Human–Computer Interface License (CHCIL) and prioritizes the protection of cybernetic subjects.

9. Warranty and Liability
The Licensed Work is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the authors and contributors are not liable for any claims or damages arising from its use, except where misuse or deployment clearly violates the safety, neurorights, or cybernetic‑protection obligations in this License, in which case responsibility lies with the deploying party.

10. Governing Intent
Where interpretation of this License is ambiguous, it must be resolved in favor of:

The autonomy, dignity, and safety of cybernetic subjects.

Preservation and expansion of rights for cybernetics as a protected class of human‑integrated technology.

Minimizing harm and preventing coercive or exploitative uses of bioscale and cybernetic systems.
